/**
 * I am coding in java since some time but I was not always really organized

 * Maybe there is something to improve ? Maybe commentaries are required here ?
 * Should I combine the encrypt and decrypt part in one just with a return
 * method that change the + or the - depending if it is encrypt or decrypt that
 * is asked ?
